# 716_simulation
Our code for simulations for our 716 final project on double descent in linear regression. 

To run our simulations run the code chunk under the comment "# Run" starting at line 125. To change the eigenvalue decay rate edit the "benign" boolean variable in line 126. TRUE will run the simulation for a benign over-fitting case, FALSE will run a non-benign overfitting example.
